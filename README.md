> have always wondered about the differences between Linux distros, which one is the best? is there a real difference between them? 
The main difference between all Linux distros is their **packages and packages manager**, they also have different kernels, Debian packages prefer old and stable kernels, however, Fedora prefers the most up-to-date ones. I don’t think of the GUI as difference, as you are completely free to **customize** and set up it as you wish whether it is GNOME, KDE Plasma, or Xfce.

Debian distributions are the most stable ones or to be more specific, it is the most concerned about stability.
It uses apt and apt-get dependency resolvers.
Some of its distributions are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, etc.

Debian distributions are the most stable ones or to be more specific, it is the most concerned about stability.

It uses apt and apt-get dependency resolvers.

Some of its distributions are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, etc.

# Pros:

Stable.
Follows the ‘OpenSource’ motto strictly.
Large hardware support(ARM, MIPS, Intel x86-based, AMD64 & Intel 64, …)
Biggest community support ever.
A large number of supported packages and development packages.

# Cons:

Not a rolling distro, meaning that you have to reinstall a new version every couple of years if you want to stay updated.
The unavailability of proprietary software which is the opposite of open source software- Like Adobe flash and Microsoft office.



# What Is a Linux Distribution?
Different companies/individuals take the Linux kernel, package it with a bootloader, desktop environment, and software and turn it into a usable operating system. They distribute it to the public for free. This is known as Linux Distribution (or “distro”). There are plenty of Linux distributions out there (more than 600), with Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, and Linux Mint some of the more commonly known. When you are installing “Linux” on your computer, you are actually installing one of these Linux distributions.


# Why linux ? for who ?
Not all Linux distributions are meant for desktop use. Some are meant for using in a server environment (CentOS), some are for security testing (Kali Linux), and there are also Linux distributions that reside in your USB drive that you can bring around with it.

Why not? You get complete control over your OS, your hardware, your privacy, and it is free. There’s also the factor of security. Linux is inherently more secure than Windows because there are fewer malware targeting it.

# Can It Run My Windows Applications?
A lot of software are cross-platform compatible, so you can run them in Windows, macOS and Linux. Examples of these are Google Chrome, Firefox, Slack, Spotify, Skype and Zoom.

For those proprietary software that don’t have a Linux counterpart, there are plenty of Linux alternatives that have the same functionality. Examples are LibreOffice (Microsoft Office alternative) and GIMP ( Photoshop alternative)


For the Apprehensive: ***Linux Mint***
For users coming from Windows, Linux Mint seems like the obvious choice. It’s based on Ubuntu, which provides great stability with software packages and balances that with a hardware enablement stack to give newer computers a fighting chance at working with Linux.

For the Power User: Fedora Workstation
Fedora Workstation is an extremely well-polished OS that provides great hardware compatibility and performance. If you have some tech experience under your belt or are looking to get a little more settled into Linux, I can’t recommend Fedora enough.

Linux Qa Fedora Neofetch
Fedora Workstation uses GNOME Shell, one of the classic Linux Desktop Environments. It’s minimal, and easy to use.


# How Can I Get Started?
You can try a Linux distribution and see if it is for you. The steps to get started are as follows:

Find the distro you want to try out.
Download its ISO file.
Create a bootable live USB
Boot it up and try out the live session.
If you like it, then install it in your PC. If not, then repeat step 1.

# Is Linux Better than Windows?
This depends on whether you are asking a Linux or Windows fanboy. For the Linux die-hard fan, the answer is an absolute “yes” for the following reasons:

Linux boots up and runs fast.
Linux, the OS and most of its software, are free.
Linux doesn’t restart your PC by itself.
Linux doesn’t force its update on you (though I would recommend you to update your system as soon as it is available).
There is a huge community of people and huge library of documentation to help you solve your Linux problem.

# what is the mmean of OS ? how to know if that OS  is  good or not 

Linux Mint was first released in August 2006 and is another operating system used for desktop and laptop computers. It is a fork of [Debian](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/ubuntu-vs-debian-whats-the-difference/) and [Ubuntu](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/ubuntu-vs-fedora-whats-the-difference/),  and is a very good alternative to the [Ubuntu desktop](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/best-ubuntu-desktop-environments/). Mint is free of cost and open source and, above all, community driven.

# what are packages dnf or apt mean ? use lnks for extra knowledge

Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Ubuntu (which is in turn based on Debian), bundled with a variety of free and open-source 

# جدول يشمل ال ديسترو وهى بيزد ع ايه واللى بيزد عليها بيزد على ايه 
# نعمل ف الاخر خالص مقارنة بين فيدورا و مينت

# why otheres make that distro ? because there waere some problems in based distro so they fix it and added some packages to Or they  edited it for special needs 

**Cons of Ubuntu**
Lacks compatibility with Debian. With Ubuntu’s frequent major changes are a double edged sword, tending to push users towards alternatives like Linux Mint.
There is a lack of a stable release schedule, that means, if you’re looking for long term support or bug fixes. Then, you’ll have to pay extra and wait longer than with other distributions.
Non LTS (or interim) versions only include nine months of security support. If you run an older version of Ubuntu and need support from Canonical. Then, you have to upgrade all your packages or wait until an LTS version  release.

------------------------------------------
# What is Mint?
Mint is an Ubuntu based community driven Linux distribution system. Well Linux Mint strives to be a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system that is powerful and easy to use. It is a free and open source operating system. Also, one of the most popular desktop [Linux distributions](https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/best-open-source-web-servers/) currently used by millions of people.

# Features of Mint
Free, open source and known for its user interface and ease of interactivity.
Provides a preinstalled application suite including LibreOffice, Mozilla, Chrome, VLC, and more.
Offers a package manager to download and install additional applications over the internet.
The design of the Linux Mint Desktop is simple, user friendly, comfortable, easy to use.
Provides long term support (LTS) versions that are supported till five years.
Built in process monitor the system tray to manage all processes and keep an eye on it.

 # Pros
 
 1.Mint is a community driven project, relying on donations from users, sponsors (such as hosting companies), and partners (who support, support, and provide services to the project)
 2.With more than 10 million users across 200 countries, Mint has become the largest mobile money app in Africa.
 3.Linux Mint gives their updates earlier because it relies on individual users and companies sponsoring its development.
 4.Mint is available in Cinnamon, MATE, KDE and Xfce versions. Flavors like GNOME, LXDE, and Fluxbox will no longer be developed.
 5.The product has been translated into 21 languages and enjoys an active user base in many countries.
 6.World’s leading open source digital wallet and crypto currency eCommerce platform.
 7.Offers a full suite of services, including an integrated digital wallet, marketplace for buying and selling goods, merchant payment gateway, cryptocurrency
 8.And now we have a gaming console/PC running Linux that actually doesn't suck, with support for Windows games.exchange, and more.
 No one hates Linux Mint, everyone hates Ubuntu because canonical, the corporation that created Ubuntu ruined it, Linux Mint is the good Ubuntu, because it's ubuntu without canonical's bullshit
 
 # Cons
1.The Linux Mint project does not provide security advice and has been criticized for not doing so on at least one occasion.
 2.it does not adhere to the principles of software freedom.
 3.Does not have support for a large number of popular applications and drivers. If you need these, you should consider other distributions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint itself.

# Desktops interfaces and usability

Interestingly Mint is a Linux distribution that is like Ubuntu. It has an interface called Cinnamon that places the taskbar at the bottom and has a start menu like the Microsoft operating system. Linux Mint also has a sidebar that lists shortcuts to use programs like Firefox and Thunderbird.

# Performance
Though Linux Mint may seem a little faster to use daily, but on older hardware, it will feel faster, while Ubuntu seems to work more better as the software ages. Mint becomes even faster when it runs, like Ubuntu.
# Compatible apps
Mint covers all the basics and with its Windows like Start menu, finding these apps is super easy. But, if you want an app that isn’t installed, both operating systems have “app stores” where you can find and download programs.

> Hello everyone!
Wanted to share my experience using linux mint 21 with you guys.
I stopped using windows last year, before W11 was released. I just could not stand all that lagging, insane delays and overheating anymore. Opening a single jpeg image was hell!
I decided to give linux a try as suggested by a friend.
My first linux distro was Ubuntu LTS (22.04 and the previous one). From that moment on i knew i could never switch back to windows again. Although i liked Ubuntu, i was getting some difficulties with zoom and streams and so i decided to give Fedora a chance.
I used fedora 36 for some time and switched to 37 beta. I enjoyed all that novelty and usability but had lots of issues with my ProtonVPN and again with zoom. Maybe i could solve those problems if i tried a bit more...but i really needed things working right, quickly, due to online lesson im currently taking.
Finally, i switched to Linux Mint 21 Vanessa (Cinammon) and i must say i'm impressed! Everything works like a charm! Its so stable, clean, efficient...I'm really happy i tried this distro and i believe it will be my choice for a long time ahead!
Thanks Linux Mint Team!

if U still not sure about Distro i Recommend read comments section of that Post on reddit [Why Linux Mint hated ?] (https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/v958x1/why_linux_mint_hated/)

> Highly recommend Mint over Ubuntu, especially if you're coming from Windows and want to learn Linux rather than wasting your time relearning a new workflow (Linux has a concept of "Desktop Environment" or DE, which is the graphical layer. You can technically swap things out in either Mint or Ubuntu, but the out-of-the-box experience for Ubuntu will have a weird layout of taskbar / window buttons vs Mint's will be similar to Windows).But more importantly, the non-profit team behind Mint is very big on respecting it's users while the company behind Ubuntu is just pushing a product and don't really care about the user experience, unless you happen to agree with all the choices they've made for you.
